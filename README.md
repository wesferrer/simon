###Game Description
>Super Simon is a Super Mario World themed version of the classic memory game, Simon. It is an electronic game of memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison. The game creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the series. If the user succeeds the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails, the game is over.
